# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project implements multiple machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes diagnoses based on medical diagnostic data. By comparing the performance of various models, this project aims to identify which algorithms are most effective for this task.

## Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements a variety of machine learning models for prediction.
- **Performance Comparison**: Provides a detailed comparison of the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and other key metrics.
- **Data Insights**: Includes exploratory data analysis for a better understanding of the dataset.

## Data
The project uses medical diagnostic data related to diabetes, such as:
- Glucose levels
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Insulin levels
- Age
- Blood pressure
- Other relevant features

Ensure the data is clean and preprocessed before training the models.

## Models Used
The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. Neural Networks
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction-model
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the models:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
4. Make predictions on new data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input <input_file>
   ```

## Results
The project provides a comparison of the models' performance based on metrics like:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

Detailed results are saved in the `results/` directory.

## Future Work
- Implement additional algorithms for prediction.
- Enhance feature selection and engineering techniques.
- Develop a web-based interface for user interaction with the model.
